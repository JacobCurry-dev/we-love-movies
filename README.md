Link to deployed heroku back-end application = https://we-love-movies-backend-capstone.onrender.com - SHOWS HAVING AN ERROR, BUT THE DATABASE DOES NOT HAVE A FRONT-END HOMEPAGE. USE ONE OF THE LINKS BELOW TO SEE THE DATA WITHIN THE DATABASE.

Link to list of Theaters = https://we-love-movies-backend-capstone.onrender.com/theaters - Use this to see the list of theaters.

The above link is not truly having an error. This is a backend-only application that only shows data within the database. Since there is no clientside application built for it yet, to navigate the database using a tool such as Postman. If you would just like to see some data show up as a GET request, you can type ```/theaters``` to pull up a list of theaters, or ```/movies``` to pull up the list of all movies showing in the theaters (or simply use the links above).
